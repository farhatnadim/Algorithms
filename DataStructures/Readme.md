## Graphs
### Undirected Graphs
#### Common terms
 * Adjacent vertices : When two vertices are connected via an edge   
 * Incident edge : An edge connecting two vertices  
 * Degree of Vertex : number of edges incident on a vertex  
 * Subgraph : As set of edges and vertices that consitute a graph  
 * Simple Path : a sequence of vertices connected by edges with no repeated vertex
 * Simple Cycle : with the except of the repetition of first and last vertex, simple cycle don't
                  have repeated vertices
 * Connected Graph : is graph that have a path from every vertex to every other vertex
 * Not Connected Graph : Consists of a set of connected components , which are maximal connected subgraph
 * Tree : is an acyclic connected graph
 * Forest : a disjoint set of trees
 * Spanning Tree : is a subgraph that contains all the vertices of the graph
 * Spanning Forest : union of Spanning Trees
