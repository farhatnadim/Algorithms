# Algorithms (Active and Work in Progress) 
This repo implements mainly the Algorithms and data structures discussed in Algorithms Illuminated (Rougharden, Standford ), Introduction to Algorithms ( Cormen at all  MIT), and Algorithms (Sedgewick, Princeton).

This is a learning journey for me . The algorithms and data structures  below are implemented. 

## Algorithms 
### Sort
[Bubble Sort ( with cocktail party Optimization)](Algorithms/Sort)  
[Insertion Sort](Algorithms/Sort/Sort.py)    
[Merge Sort](Algorithms/Sort)    

### Search
[Binary Search](Algorithms/Search)
[Second Largest](Algorithms/Search)  

### Misc
[Recursive Multiplication](Algorithms/RecursiveIntegerMultiplication)  
[Karatsuba Multiplication](Algorithms/RecursiveIntegerMultiplication)  
[ThreeSum](Algorithms/NSum/ThreeSum.py)


## Data Structures
[Simple Linked List](DataStructures/List/LinkedList.py)  
[Double Linked List](DataStructures/Lists/DoubeLinkedList.py)

## Appendices
