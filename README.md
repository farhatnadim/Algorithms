# Algorithms (Active and Work in Progress) 
This repo implements mainly the Algorithms and data structures discussed in Algorithms Illuminated (Rougharden, Standford ), Introduction to Algorithms ( Cormen at all  MIT), and Algorithms (Sedgewick, Princeton).

This is a learning journey for me . The algorithms and data structures  below are implemented. 

## Algorithms 
## Sort
### Bubble Sort ( with cocktail party Optimization) 
### Insertion Sort 
### Merge Sort

## Search
### Binary Search 
### Second Largest

#### Recursive Multiplication
[Implemented Here](RecursiveIntegerMultiplication)
#### Karatsuba Multiplication
[Implemented Here](RecursiveIntegerMultiplication)
#### ThreeSum
Both brute force and Quick version (N^2Log(N))

## DataStructures
### Simple Linked List
### Double Linked List 

## Appendices 
###
